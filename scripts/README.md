# Processing Scripts

This folder contains data processing scripts.

## Data layout

Our data layout is:

- data/PROJECT_NAME/
  - SerialEM navigator files
  - SerialEM montage files
  - crystal images
  - screening images (diffraction snap shots)
  - raw/ <--- Verlox writes uncompressed EMDs here
  - compressed/ <--- `repack_emd.py` writes compressed EMDs here

## Compression

Verlox's EMD file is in the HDF5 container but uncompressed.
Typical MicroED data can be compressed to less than 50 % of the original size.

Unfortunately, compression by the `h5repack` command is very slow due toã€€an
inefficient access pattern, as discussed [here](https://forum.hdfgroup.org/t/speeding-up-h5repack/1145).
Our `repack_emd.py` reads data in a more efficient way and compresses about 40 times faster.

On the on-the-fly processing node called `talos-otf`, which can access microscope's storage,
we run the following one-liner to compress Verlox EMD files.

```sh
while true; do find -name '*.emd*' -mmin +3 | parallel -P8 dials.python repack_emd.sh {} ../compressed/\`echo {} \| sed -e 's,\ ,_,g'\`; sleep 60; done&
```

This also replaces annoying whitespaces in the file name into underscores.
For example, `Camera Ceta 20230611 2324 670 mm.emd` becomes `Camera_Ceta_20230611_2324_670_mm.emd`.

`-mmin +3` is to prevent processing files being recorded.
But this might not be necessary, because Verlox locks files anyway.

## Transfer to our cluster

Further processing is performed on a cluster node.
A cluster node periodically runs `rsync` to copy images from the microscope storage.

```sh
while true; do rsync -avuP --exclude raw --exclude '*.tmp' talos-otf:/mnt/falcon/USER/PROJECT_NAME . ; sleep 90; done&
```

## Processing with DIALS

First of all, install [FormatVelox.py](https://github.com/dials/dxtbx_ED_formats/blob/main/FormatVelox.py)
to DIALS via `dxtbx.install_format` command to read Verlox EMD movies.

We make a separate work directory and make a symbolic link called `images` to the `compressed` folder.
For each crystal, we make a subdirectory, within which each processing trial has its own directory.
In this example, we have two trials, one called P1 (without known unit cell) and mP (with prior cell parameters
and a monoclinic constraint).

- work/PROJECT_NAME/
  - pixels.mask
  - process_P1.sh
  - process_mP.sh
  - images/ ---> a symbolic link to data/PROJECT_NAME/compressed
  - YYYYMMDD_HHMM/ ---> a crystal
    - P1/
    - mP/
  - YYYYMMDD_HHMM/ ---> another crystal
    - P1/
    - mP/

This is done by `process_P1.sh` and `process_mP.sh`.

We first run `process_P1.sh` as follows:

```
find images/ -name "*.emd" -size +50M | cut -d_ -f 3,4  | tee LIST | parallel -P8 --ungroup bash process_P1.sh
```

(Of course parameters such as resolution limits and the beam center have to be adjusted beforehand.)

The size filter is to ignore empty movies; we don't know why but sometimes Verlox fails to capture movies.
This happened about 1 in 50 movies.

The script performs spot finding, indexing (without known unit cell) and integration.
Empty frames are filtered (see below) and the Patterson group is estimated.
Finally the intensities before and after blank removal are scaled in P1 to give a rough estimate of data quality.

## dials.filter_blanks

Often crystals go out of the beam during rotation or die due to radiation damage.
Integrating empty frames leads to strange merging statistics including negative R factors.
`filter_blanks.py` removes such empty frames.

This script was originally written by Graeme Winter as a [pull request to DIALS](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/2232),
but has never been merged. Takanori Nakane (hopefully) fixed bugs in frame indexing (see the above pull request for details).

## Summarizing the result

`list.sh` produces a nice table of processing results:

```
bash list.sh P1/not_blank | sort -rnk2 | tee RESO-P1-nb
```

The table lists the path, resolution at which CC1/2 drops below 0.3, unit cell parameters (before cosym)
and symmetry suggested by `dials.cosym`.

```
20230612_0222/P1 1.26     Unit cell: 5.344  6.4788  10.84  90.00  90.20  90.02 Best solution: P 1 2/m 1
20230609_1245/P1 0.92     Unit cell: 5.336  6.4611  10.860  90.14  91.3  90.66 Best solution: P 1 2/m 1
...
```

Without `/not_blank`, the table is created for intensities before blank frame removal.

At this point, we manually merge promising crystals and try phasing.

## Reprocessing with prior cell parameters

Once we know the right space group and the cell parameters, we set it to `process_mP.sh`
to reprocess datasets with prior cell information and Bravais lattice constraints.

```
parallel -P8 --ungroup bash process_mP.sh < LIST
```

Note that this uses the spot finding results from the `P1` jobs.
So you have to run `process_P1.sh` beforehand.
This is good, because indexing with prior cell parameters rejects all
crystals with different cell parameters. Thus, you might miss rare
crystal polymorphs.
